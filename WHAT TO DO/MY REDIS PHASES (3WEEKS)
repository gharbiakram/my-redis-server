Project Phases (With Realistic Weekly Goals)
✅ Phase 1: Setup + Echo Server (1–2 days) **********

    Create a new project in CLion ✅

    Write a TCP server that accepts one client and echoes messages back✅

    Understand Winsock if you're on Windows✅

✅ Phase 2: Command Recognition (2–3 days) TODO

    Convert received raw messages into commands

    Support: PING, ECHO <msg>, SET key value, GET key, DEL key

    No need for full RESP support yet — just split text

✅ Phase 3: In-Memory Storage (2–3 days)

    Store data in std::unordered_map<std::string, std::string>

    Make SET, GET, and DEL operate on it

    Clean up command handling into functions

✅ Phase 4: RESP Protocol (3–4 days)

    Parse real Redis protocol: RESP (REdis Serialization Protocol)

    Support clients like redis-cli

    Example: *3\r\n$3\r\nSET\r\n$3\r\nkey\r\n$5\r\nvalue\r\n

✅ Phase 5: Multiclient (4–5 days)

    Use select() or threads to handle multiple clients

    Handle one client at a time for now; scale later if you wish
